add the go implementation.  
- it is important that the code have the same functionality but it doesn't have to be strictly modeled after the rust implementation
- it should have a similar structure with a main function that gathers command line arguments and  a functiuon that executes the query.
- it should be idiomatic go code. 
- use standard libraries if possible. 
- use the superpower skill if that makes sense   
- include tests
